" Hey , Programmer welcome to the world of the Prompt Engg"


Introduction About the Prompt Engg : -

Prompt engineering or in-context learning is an approach used in teaching a large language model to do anything that 
it was not part of its pre-training. The results of learning are, however, contained within a single conversation and 
completely forgotten by the model outside it.

LLM [ Large language model]

There are broadly two type of LLM models in the development feild :- 

1. Based LLM : - Predict the next word based on text training data.

For Eg : - 
Example 1 : -
Prompt Given : - Once upon a time there was a unicorn 
Rest of the things AutoCompleted :- that lived in the magical forest with all the unicorn friends.

-> What is the currency of the France ?

2. Instruction Tuned LLM :- 
a. Tries to follow the instructions
b. Fine tune on the instructions and good attempt at following the instructions
c. RLHF :- It work on the Algorithms of the Reinforcement learning with Human Feedback

Helpful , Honest , Harmless
